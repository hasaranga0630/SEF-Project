# Mobile inventory app

This Flutter scaffold shares the web client's login contract:

- `POST /api/auth/login` with `{ "email", "password" }`.
- Response containing `accessToken` or `token`.
- JWT roles: `Admin`, `Manager`, and `Staff`; plus `tenant_id`.

Tokens are stored with `flutter_secure_storage`, using Android encrypted shared
preferences and the iOS Keychain. The app clears expired or malformed tokens on
startup. It never stores passwords.

Authenticated inventory feature screens should obtain their request client from
`auth.authenticatedClient()`. The shared client adds `Authorization: Bearer
<token>` to every request; screens must never read or persist the token.

## Offline stock count

The **Stock count** tab saves a cached inventory catalog and each physical count
locally. A saved count is an absolute on-hand quantity; when the app reconnects,
it reloads the server quantity and submits only the required adjustment. Pending
counts are retained until the server accepts them, and the Sync button can be
used to retry manually.

## Run

After generating platform folders with `flutter create .`, fetch packages and run
against the local API:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5298
```

Flutter Web always uses `http://localhost:5298`; do not use `10.0.2.2` in a
browser. If the app was previously started with an Android `--dart-define`,
stop it and restart the web target so the updated configuration is compiled.

`10.0.2.2` is the Android emulator's route to the host machine. On a physical
device, replace it with the computer's LAN IP address. For an iOS simulator, use
`http://localhost:5298`.

For Android emulator:

```powershell
flutter run -d emulator-5554 --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:5298
```

For a physical Android device, use the computer's LAN address and restart the
app after changing the value:

```powershell
flutter run -d <device-id> --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.10:5298
```

The backend must be running on `0.0.0.0:5298`, and Windows Firewall must allow
inbound TCP traffic on port 5298. The `API_BASE_URL` value is compiled into the
app, so hot reload does not change it.

The Android app requires a minimum SDK level of 23 for secure encrypted storage.
