/* Act II: the core becomes a platform.
 *
 * Inside the shell, six module clusters arrive from off-camera and lock onto
 * landing sites on the lattice, one per slice of the act, each drawing a line
 * back to the core as it seats. By the end all six sit on one skeleton with
 * shared edges between them - which is the "one core, six surfaces" claim
 * made structurally instead of asserted in a sentence.
 *
 * The captions and the fallback list are the same six nodes. Rendering them
 * twice - once for the 3D path and once for everything else - is how the two
 * drift apart, and the copy is the part that has to stay true.
