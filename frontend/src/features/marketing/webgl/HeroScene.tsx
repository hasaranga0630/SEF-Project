/* The hero: a real 3D scene in WebGL, scrubbed by scroll.
 *
 * A geodesic wireframe sphere with glowing vertices, inside a drifting
 * particle shell. Scroll drives the camera's orbit and dolly and the amount
 * the surface is displaced; the pointer nudges the camera a little further.
 * Because rotation is a pure function of scroll position rather than time,
 * scrubbing back up runs the whole thing backwards exactly.
 *
 * Falls back to the 2D canvas orbit when WebGL is unavailable or the context
 * is lost - a visitor on a locked-down browser gets the lesser sculpture
