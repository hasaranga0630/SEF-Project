/* Lenis-equivalent smooth scrolling, hand-rolled.
 *
 * The real thing (npm `lenis`) is not installable on this network - the
 * registry answers 403 for every package, a condition this repo already
 * documents in vitest.config.ts. This is the same technique in ~120 lines:
 * intercept the wheel, hold a target scroll position, and ease the real
 * scroll toward it on requestAnimationFrame.
 *
 * To swap in the real library later: `npm i lenis`, then replace the body of
 * this hook with `new Lenis({ lerp })` plus its rAF loop. Everything else on
 * the page reads scroll through window.scrollY, which Lenis also drives, so
 * nothing downstream changes.
 *
 * Deliberately opt-in per page rather than global: it is mounted by the
 * landing page only. Hijacking the wheel inside the admin console - which
 * has scrollable tables and modals - would make it feel broken.
