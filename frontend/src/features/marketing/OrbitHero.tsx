/* The web counterpart of the Flutter app's OrbitHero
 * (mobile/sme_mobile/lib/widgets/unify_auth/orbit_hero.dart): intertwined
 * rings orbiting a glowing core.
 *
 * Same four rings, same silver/cyan/magenta ordering and the same staggered
 * speeds - what sells the "intertwined" look is that no two rings share a
 * rhythm, so at any moment some are edge-on while others are face-on.
 *
 * Rings are bordered ellipses rotated in 3D rather than SVG strokes: the
 * browser composites transforms on the GPU, so four spinning at once costs
 * nothing, and the shape stays crisp at any size. */
