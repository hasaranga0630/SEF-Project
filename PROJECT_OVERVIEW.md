# SE3090_SE002 — Universal SME Booking Platform

A multi-tenant SaaS booking platform originally built for clinics and generalized to any
appointment/reservation-based small business — clinics, restaurants, gyms, tuition
centers, real estate agencies, tourism operators, and general services. One backend,
one admin web app, one customer/staff mobile app, shared by every tenant.

## Architecture: three apps, one backend

- **`backend/SmeBackend`** — the only thing that talks to the database. Every tenant's
  data lives in the same tables, isolated by `TenantId` (multi-tenant, shared-schema
  model). Role-based auth via JWT: `Admin`, `Manager`, `Staff`, `Customer`, plus
  a single platform-level `SuperAdmin` (the site owner) that is not a tenant
  role and only the `/platform` console accepts.
- **`frontend/` (web)** — **Admin/Manager/Staff only.** Business setup, resource/staff
  management, booking-type configuration, calendar/booking management, reports, agent
  workflow approvals. There is no customer-facing flow in the web app by design.
- **`mobile/sme_mobile/` (Flutter)** — **Customer and Staff.** Customers browse
  businesses, book, manage their own bookings, get notifications. Staff use it for
  their own schedule and QR check-in scanning. Two separate registration flows:
  `RegisterScreen` (business/tenant onboarding, mirrors the web's `RegisterPage`) and
  `CustomerRegisterScreen` (a customer account - global, no business to pick; opened
  from a business's page it also joins that business; forces `Role=Customer`
  server-side).

## Customer accounts are global

A customer signs up once (web `RegisterPage` "A customer" mode, or the app's
"Create a customer account") with no business chosen, and is joined to a
business automatically the first time they open it. The model that makes this
work without touching any tenant-side code is in
`backend/SmeBackend/Services/CustomerAccountService.cs`:

- the sign-in is one **identity** row (`Role=Customer`) in a hidden
  "Unify Customers" tenant (`BusinessType=CustomerPool`, excluded from the
  public directory and the platform console);
- each business they use gets a **membership** row in that tenant - an ordinary
  per-business Customer user, which is what every dashboard, report and booking
  already expects - with `User.LinkedAccountId` pointing at the identity;
- `POST /api/auth/join/{tenantId}` creates the membership on first contact and
  returns a token scoped to that business (the resource/slot/booking endpoints
  are scoped by the token's tenant). The app calls it when a customer opens a
  business whose id differs from the token's (`BusinessDetailScreen`);
- only identity rows can log in; profile and password changes propagate to
  every membership; `GET /api/bookings` and ownership checks treat the whole
  account (identity + memberships) as one person, so "My bookings" spans
  businesses. Legacy per-business customers keep working unchanged and become
  the identity of any business they join later.

## Multi-tenant data model

```
Tenant (BusinessType, SubType) ──┬── Branch
                                  ├── TenantModule (per-business-type feature flags/config)
                                  ├── User (Admin/Manager/Staff/Customer, JWT login)
                                  ├── Resource (the bookable thing: a doctor, a table,
                                  │     a boat, a room, a vehicle...) ── ResourceSchedule
                                  │                                    ── ResourceScheduleException
                                  ├── BookingType (the product being sold: "Consultation",
                                  │     "Whale Watching Tour", "Room Stay"...)
                                  └── Booking (an actual reservation)
```

Key generic-by-design fields:
- **`Resource.Category`**: `Room | Equipment | Vehicle | Staff | Desk | Other`
- **`Resource.CustomAttributes`** (JSONB): free-form per-resource metadata (rating,
  pricing tiers, capacity, season, includes/excludes...) — consumed by both the admin
  UI and the Agentic AI's ranking logic.
- **`BookingType.BookingUnit`**: `Slot | Night | DateRange | Package` — see
  "Universal Tourism Booking System" below.
- **`BookingType.ConfigJson`** (JSONB): free-form per-booking-type config matching the
  chosen unit (weather-dependent, cancellation policy, check-in/out time, itinerary...).

Business types: `Clinic, Restaurant, Gym, School, RealEstate, Tourism, General`. Tourism
tenants additionally carry a `SubType` (one of 11 real sub-categories — see below).

## Business types & booking shapes supported

Originally built clinic-first, the schema is now genuinely business-type-neutral:

| Business type | Example resource | Booking unit used |
|---|---|---|
| Clinic | Doctor | Slot |
| Restaurant | Table | Slot |
| Gym | Trainer | Slot |
| School/Tuition | Tutor | Slot |
| RealEstate | Agent | Slot |
| General | Technician | Slot |
| Tourism — wildlife/safari/whale-watching/surf/dive/hiking/cultural tours | Boat, jeep, guide | Slot |
| Tourism — Accommodation | Room | **Night** (check-in/check-out) |
| Tourism — Vehicle rental | Car/van | **DateRange** (multi-day) |
| Tourism — Multi-day packages | Tour coordinator | **Package** (date range + itinerary) |

See `docs/tourism-business-template.md` for the full sub-type analysis and the
`ConfigJson` schema design.

## Universal Tourism Booking System (booking units)

The booking engine originally only supported one shape: pick a resource, pick a day,
pick a fixed-duration time slot (`SlotCalculator` + `GET /bookings/available-slots`).
That's correct for consultations, tours, and lessons, but wrong for accommodation
(booked by night) and vehicle rental (booked by date range). Rather than building a
separate code path per business type, `BookingType.BookingUnit` drives one of four
handlers, reused by any business that needs that shape:

- **Slot** — the original behavior, unchanged. Fixed-duration time slots within a
  resource's weekly `ResourceSchedule`.
- **Night** — check-in/check-out dates with configurable check-in/check-out times
  (default 14:00/11:00). Availability comes from `GET /bookings/unavailable-ranges`
  (existing bookings only — no weekly schedule needed).
- **DateRange** — multi-day start/end dates (vehicle rental, equipment rental).
- **Package** — one date-range reservation against a primary resource plus a
  structured itinerary (`[{day, title}]`) rendered to the customer. (Not true
  multi-resource atomic composite booking — a deliberately scoped-down version;
  see `docs/tourism-business-template.md` for the reasoning.)

`Resource`/`Booking` creation and conflict-detection logic required **zero changes**
for the new units — the existing overlap check is a plain `DateTime` interval
comparison, not tied to sub-day durations. Only availability *display* (the new
endpoint) and the client UI needed new code.

Proven end-to-end with real, sourced businesses (not test fixtures): **Mirissa
Jetliner** (whale watching, Slot), **The Wallawwa** (accommodation, Night), **Malkey
Rent A Car** (vehicle rental, DateRange) — all seeded from each operator's real
website via `scripts/seed-tourism-night-daterange.ps1` / `seed-mirissa-jetliner.ps1`.

## Feature scope (functional requirements)

Tracked against three requirement sets:

- **FR-B1–FR-B12** (Booking & Resource Engine core) — ✅ fully implemented.
- **FR-AS1–FR-AS11, FR-AS21–FR-AS24** (Admin & Staff: account/access, business setup,
  booking management, agent-workflow oversight, tenant isolation) — ✅ fully implemented.
- **FR-AS12–FR-AS20** (Billing + Inventory: invoices, payments, insurance claims,
  revenue dashboards, stock in/out, suppliers, PO approvals) — ⏸️ **explicitly
  deferred**. Only unused C# model stubs exist (`Invoice`, `InventoryItem`, `Supplier`,
  `Payment`, `InsuranceClaim`, `PurchaseOrder`, ...); they aren't even registered as
  `DbSet`s in `AppDbContext`, so there's no schema for them yet. Treat as a fresh,
  separately-scoped project if picked up later.
- **FR-C1–FR-C11** (Customer actor: browse, book, manage own bookings, notifications)
  — ✅ fully implemented, mobile-only.

  `auth_provider.dart`, `public_tenant_provider.dart`, ...).
- `models/` — Hand-written JSON models (`Resource`, `BookingType`, `Booking`, ...).

## Agentic AI subsystem (`agentic-ai-service/`)

A separate Python FastAPI microservice implementing a real 4-agent LLM pipeline
(Planner → Domain Analysis → Action/Tool → Validation/Safety, via Gemini), called only
by the ASP.NET Core backend (never directly by the web or mobile apps) through a
shared-secret bearer token. Handles natural-language objectives like *"find me the
best dentist this week"* or *"book a whale watching trip for 4 people this weekend."*
The Validation/Safety agent is plain deterministic Python (never calls Gemini) and is
the only place allowed to create a booking. Converges on the same `AgentWorkflow`
table and `/approve`/`/reject`/`/apply` endpoints as the older deterministic bulk
scheduler, rather than replacing it. Requires a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in
`agentic-ai-service/.env` to exercise live (test suite mocks Gemini entirely).

The inventory area also includes a separate read-only agent workflow at
`POST /api/inventory/agent/plan` → `POST /inventory/plan`. It uses the signed-in
inventory user's authorization to read stock and recent movements, then recommends
replenishment quantities with a deterministic safety check. It never changes stock
or creates an order; a staff member reviews any recommendation in the existing
purchase-order flow. The Low Stock Alerts page explains limited history and lower
confidence when no explicit usage movements exist.

## Data & deployment

- Database: Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL (`se3090-booking-db`). Table names for the
  core booking domain are lowercase snake_case (`resources`, `bookings`,
  `booking_types`, ...) via explicit EF `ToTable()` calls; `Tenants`/`Users`/
  `Branches`/`TenantModules` keep PascalCase (default EF convention). Columns stay
  PascalCase throughout regardless of table naming.
- Real connection string lives in `dotnet user-secrets` (not `appsettings.json`,
  which only has a local-Postgres placeholder) — run backend commands with
  `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` to pick it up.
- Demo/seed data: `scripts/seed-demo-data.ps1` (one business per core type),
  `scripts/seed-mirissa-jetliner.ps1` and `scripts/seed-tourism-night-daterange.ps1`
  (real Tourism sub-type examples), `scripts/seed-tourism-template.ps1` (reusable
  scaffold for adding more).

## Known gaps

- Billing/Inventory (FR-AS12-20) not started — schema stubs only.
- "Package" bookings don't do true atomic multi-resource composite reservation.
- Per-ticket-type pricing (e.g. adult/child counts within one booking) isn't modeled
  natively — approximated via `CustomAttributes`/`ConfigJson` metadata only.
- Some legacy junk/test tenant data exists in the live database from earlier manual
  testing (not cleaned up per user's own choice to leave it for now).
